## FitLit Data Generator

This repo is used to generate random activity data for a set of random users - think FitBit style of data.

**Note:** `Array.flat()` is used in this code, which means you must use node v11^ to generate the data files.

## How to Use the Script

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
1. Run the main script to generate all data with `node index.js` (the files generated are written to the `output` directory)

## How to Adjust the Data

In the `index.js` file, there are some paramters you can adjust to change the data. The number of users to be generated and number of days of data generated for each user can be adjusted with these global variables:

```js
global.numUsers = 2;
global.numDays = 5;
```

In the `src` directory, there are files for generating kinds of data (hydration, sleep, etc.). Within these files, random numbers within a range are used to generate the data:

```js
generateValueWithinRange([minumum value], [maximum value], [decimal precision of the generated value]);
```

## Future Plans

* Add an avatar image to user object. The avatar url image generated by `faker` tends to be all dudes with not amazing photos...looking for another source.
* Add normal/gaussian distribution for generating random numbers based on a user average (mu) custom for each user so that the activity data isn't so erratic and different people can have different ranges.

## Data Model

**Users**

```
[
  {
    "id": [number],
    "name": [string],
    "address": [string],
    "email": [string],
    "strideLength": [number - feet],
    "dailyStepGoal": [number - steps],
    "friends": [array - one-way connection to other user(s)]
  },
  ...more user data
]
```

**Activity**

```
[
  {
    "userID": [number],
    "date": [string YYYY/MM/DD],
    "numSteps": [number - steps],
    "minutesActive": [number - minutes],
    "flightsOfStairs": [number - flights]
  },
  ...more activity data
]
```

**Hydration**

```
[
  {
    "userID": [number],
    "date": [string YYYY/MM/DD],
    "numOunces": [number - ounces]
  },
  ...more hydration data
]
```

**Sleep**

```
[
  {
    "userID": [number],
    "date": [string YYYY/MM/DD],
    "hoursSlept": [number - hours],
    "sleepQuality": [number - unitless]
  },
  ...more sleep data
]
```
